This repository contains the "game" content for the prototype engine found at https://github.com/SamVanheer/PrototypeEngine

It's not so much a game as it is a collection of tools that includes a pseudo-engine tool.

This repository includes the Steamworks SDK runtime. This runtime is subject to Valve's Steamworks SDK license, as is all other Valve content included within this repository.

The programs contained in this repository are not intended to violate any licenses or restrictions, but are instead intended to expand the feature set of the existing engine and provide useful tools to GoldSource developers.
